			<p>
			Montego Bay, Affectionately called Mobay. Montego Bay is the second largest city in Jamaica by area and the fourth by 
			population (after Kingston, Spanish Town and Portmore). It is a tourist destination with hotels, restaurants, tourist 
			attractions, duty-free shopping, a cruise line terminal and several beaches. The city is backed by picturesque low mountains.

			The coastland near Montego Bay is occupied by numerous tourist resorts, most newly built, some occupying the grounds of old 
			sugar cane plantations with some of the original buildings and mill-works still standing. The most famous of these are the 
			White Witch's Rose Hall and Tryall, both of which now feature world-class golf courses.

			The infrastructure of the city is going through a series of explosive modernizations which once completed, aims to keep Montego 
			Bay as a top destination in the Caribbean.
			</p>
			<h1>HOTELS</h1>
			<p>
				Similar to the plethora of things to do is the vast number of resorts and hotels in Montego Bay. You'll find an 
				assortment of beachfront properties, all-inclusive resorts that cater to both families and adults, villas for large 
				groups, and apartments and boutique hotels for the astute traveler. Stay in the center of the action close to the 
				energetic “Hip Strip,” which is Gloucester Avenue where the coast lies just on the other side of businesses that line 
				the avenue, or browse any of the more relaxed options in the hills above the city and the outskirts of the town. 
				Choosing to stay at a hotel in Montego Bay is ideal for those wanting to tour several major attraction sites in 
				opposite directions. It's smackdab in the middle of Ocho Rios, Negril, and St. Elizabeth, which makes it perfect 
				for those planning day trips to see and do it all.
			</p>
			<h1>ACTIVITIES</h1>
			<p>
				You can go on an epic eco-adventure with Cockpit Country Adventure Tours where you’ll journey through awe-inspiring 
				caverns gleaming with wondrous geographical treasures that were once a hideout for Maroon warriors. Or, take the family 
				or friend group over to Paintball Jamaica for a fun-filled day of play in a wooded area with plenty of shade. Another 
				option is a relaxing and blissful ride down the Martha Brae River on a carefully hand-crafted bamboo raft surrounded 
				by nothing but greenery and water with the sound of wind breezing through the trees, flowing streams, and birds singing.
				You'll also find lots of different types of beaches here to explore along with an abundance of water activities among the multitude of 
				things to do in Montego Bay.

			<h1>HARMONY BEACH AND PARK</h1>
			<div class="parish-img3">

			<p>
				Harmony Beach Park complex is rejuvenating the South end of Montego Bay's Hip Strip along Howard Cooke Boulevard.
				Harmony Beach Park is a free, public access facility in Montego Bay, Jamaica. At Harmony Beach, you can find your 
				adventure and immerse yourself in all things Jamaican - sun, sea and sand!
				<br>
				Currently, the beach is open 9am-6pm on Wednesday to Saturday and from 9am-4pm on Sundays. And the Park everyday 
				from 9am to 12am (mid-night)
				The park has modern bathroom facilities with showers and changing rooms.
				There are limited shady areas on the beach, so an umbrella would be handy for those looking to escape the Montego Bay sun.
				An umbrella and beach loungers are available for rent, for $500 JMD each.
        
				There is also a large basketball court, running trail and a kid's play area. Unfortunately, neither of these features were 
				available during our visit, but the playground space is available through a booking system for private events only.
				To book a birthday parties or other special occasions, email the park at harmonybeachpark@udcja.com to schedule.
				Kid's play area hours are 8am-6pm and 8am-4pm on Sundays.
				Plenty of grass space is available on the sprawling, shady green lawn. It is the perfect spot to lay out a blanket 
				and enjoy picnic in the park. Or find a shady gazebo to hang out and relax.
