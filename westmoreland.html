			<p>
				Kool Runnings Adventure Park prides itself on meeting and exceeding international standards. The facility holds membership
				in the World Water Park Association and their lifeguards are internationally certified. As the largest waterpark in 
				Jamaica, Kool Runnings has a variety of activities for guests including waterslides and tubing. But the adventures are 
				not just in the water - there is go-kart racing and paintball. There's an adventure waiting - head to Kool Runnings 
				Waterpark in Negril!
				<br>
				<span class="highlight"> KAYAKING ADVENTURE </span> - The adventure zone features fibre glass 2 person kayaks that can be operated by one or two persons.
				Patrons can go kayaking the length of the canal on the great morass, taking time to see the fish, birds and wildlife in
				the wetlands. This adventure requires the ability to swim and previous experience in kayaking. Approved life jackets
				must be worn by all on this ride.
				<br>
				<span class="highlight"> PAINTBALL ADVENTURE </span>  - Paintball gaming consists of opposing persons or teams, using a shooting instrument known as a 
				'Marker' to tag each other with a projectile consisting of a small ball of paint. The paintball breaks on contact with 
				the target & it leaves a coloured mark on the clothes or skin of the opponent. Once an opponent is hit, he/she is out of 
				the game. There are many different games that are played, under the watchful eye of our 'marshalls' who regulate the game 
				& see to the safety of the operation.
				<br>
				<span class="highlight"> 4 SPIN HUMAN GYROSCOPE </span> - Test your astronaut skill this summer on our new, first of its kind, human gyroscope, which takes
				4 people on the heart pumping gyrations experienced by astronauts in space. These gyroscopes are used by nasa in the training
				and preparations of candidates for outer space.
				<br>
				<span class="highlight"> JAMBOO RAFTING </span>  - Jamaica has been famous for it's two-person bamboo rafting on the Rio Grande & Martha Brae rivers, 
				but now, Kool Running's offers a new concept of “Family Bamboo Rafting” that can take up to six adults on a casual fling 
				on a lazy canal through Negril's famous Great Morass. Two & four person rafting is also available on this unforgettable 
				encounter. Each boat is powered by one or two guides using traditional bamboo poles.
