			<h1> At. Ann, You Can't Miss It</h1>
			<div class="parish-img">

			<p>
				St. Ann is called the garden parish of Jamaica for a reason. Its landscape varies from enthralling beaches, beach 
				resorts and villas to stunning waterfalls, tropical rainforest beauty and of course, the omnipresent backdrop of 
				imposing mountains. Just about any kind of ecotourist, beach, thrill-seeking or cultural tourism can be had in St. Ann, 
				Jamaica's largest parish.
			</p>
			<h1>HOTELS</h1>
			<p>
				Similar to the plethora of things to do is the vast number of resorts and hotels in Montego Bay. You'll find an 
				assortment of beachfront properties, all-inclusive resorts that cater to both families and adults, villas for large 
				groups, and apartments and boutique hotels for the astute traveler. Stay in the center of the action close to the 
				energetic “Hip Strip,” which is Gloucester Avenue where the coast lies just on the other side of businesses that line 
				the avenue, or browse any of the more relaxed options in the hills above the city and the outskirts of the town. 
				Choosing to stay at a hotel in Montego Bay is ideal for those wanting to tour several major attraction sites in 
				opposite directions. It's smackdab in the middle of Ocho Rios, Negril, and St. Elizabeth, which makes it perfect 
				for those planning day trips to see and do it all.
			</p>
			<h1>RESTURANTS</h1>
			<div class="parish-img2">

			</div>
			<p>
				The Ocho Rios restaurants you ultimately choose to dine at really come down to what cuisine you're in the mood for. 
				If your travel bucket list includes indulging in our island's famous jerk dishes, some of the best local spots to taste 
				the authentic meal are rustic-chic Scotchies Jerk Centre and Lyming at Walkerswood rest stop just before the miles-long 
				green canopy of Fern Gully. Further excite your taste buds with internationally styled culinary selections. Treat your
				palate at Stush in the Bush's organic farm-to-table experience in the mountains; EXempty Seasfood at Lobster Dave 
				sample a taste of France at L'Escargot or tour Italy at Evita; and try fusion cuisine at Usain Bolt's Tracks and 
				Records that'll take your appetite "to di world".
			</p>
			<h1>ACTIVITIES</h1>
			<p>
				You're on island time the moment you set foot in Jamaica. Ocho Rios, a port of call for many cruise lines, 
				also boasts some of the most luxe resorts and spas in the Caribbean. Despite the common phrase that you shouldn't
			    chase waterfall in Jamaica, St. Ann that is specfically what you should do. From the Amzing Dunn's River Falls to the 
				Majesctic Seven Falls of Turtle River Park ... these falls a just worth it. 
			    And once you've had your stresses melted away in the island sun, you can head out for a night of dancing and reggae music.

			<h1>WHAT TO DO IN ST. ANN</h1>
			<section>
				<div class="parish-img">
				<img src="images/stann.png" alt="St. Ann">
				</div>
				<p>
					Sight seeing the Grren Grotto Caves. Named for the green algae which once covered their walls, the Green Grotto Caves
					in Discovery Bay blend ecotourism and history into a 45-minute tour. These caves, secret passages and caverns have 
					played a pivotal role in Jamaica's history - first used by Jamaica's earliest inhabitants the Tainos for hundreds of
					years as a home, source of food and sacred ground, by the Spanish and later runaway slaves as a hideaway, by 
					smugglers running arms to Cuba between the two World Wars then in more recent times as a rum barrel storehouse.
					<br>
					Visit the Seville Heritage Park in Saint Ann's Bay marks one of the first encounters between Old and New World. 
					Unless you're Jamaican or took Caribbean history classes, you're likely hearing for the first time that 
					English-speaking Jamaica was first colonized by the Spanish hence the town Sevilla la Nueva was named for Seville,
					Spain. Christopher Columbus first set foot in Jamaica in 1494 making an already well-known inhabited island first 
					known to Europe. In 1503-4 he lived at the well-developed Taino town of Maima for over a year with his men after 
					getting shipwrecked. However, it wasn't until 1509 that Sevilla la Nueva was established becoming the first
					permanent European settlement in Jamaica and changing Jamaican, European and World History forever.
					<br>
					Puerto Seco is a white sand beach located along Jamaica's north coast in the historic town of Discovery Bay, 
					St. Ann. Christopher Columbus is believed to have first landed in Jamaica on this beach with his three ships Santa 
					Maria, Pinta and Niña in 1494. For this same reason, a park named after him lies just five minutes drive away.
					Recently leased and refurbished by the Guardsman Group security company, Puerto Seco is one of Jamaica's most iconic 
					beaches and was renovated to highlight that historic charm.

			<h1>Dunn's River Falls and Park</h1>
			<div class="parish-img3">
				<img src="images/duns1.png" alt="Dunn's River Falls and Park">
			</div>
			<p>
				Dunn's River Falls and Park is a state-run tourist attraction featuring a naturally-occuring cascade which flows out to 
				the Caribbean Sea along Jamaica's north coast. It has been minimally modified with cement to create footholds, making it
				 safer and easier for tourists to climb but that's about it. If the tiers seem too perfect to believe they're natural, 
				 that's because Jamaica's limestone richness and our abundant rivers create magic when they meet, carving out thousands 
				 of caves and dozens of perfectly tiered cascades throughout the whole island which are a sight to behold. They didn't 
				 name Jamaica from the Arawakan word meaning "land of wood and water" for nothing.

			<h1>Turtle River Falls and Park</h1>
			<div class="parish-img">
				<img src="images/coifish pan.png" alt="Turtle River Falls and Park">
			</div>
			<p>
				Turtle River Park is a cool oasis in the busy heart of resort town Ocho Rios. This small park is perfect for a picnic, 
				stroll or jog, for reading, watching the fish and turtles in the stream which runs through the grounds and for 
				entertaining bored children on its playground in the heat of the day. With fish, turtles, a coi fish pond/river, water falls and
				playground but minus the formidable 11-foot tall Redemption Song sculptures symbolizing our freedom. Once you find 
				yourself in Ocho Rios and want a beautiful well-tended green space in which to relax, consider checking out Turtle River Park.
